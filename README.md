Objective:
To analyze and predict customer churn using machine learning techniques, helping businesses
reduce customer loss and improve retention strategies.
Problem Statement:
Customer churn is a critical metric for subscription-based businesses. Predicting which customers
are likely to leave helps in taking proactive retention actions.
Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Data Collection:
- Dataset includes demographics, service details, billing, and churn label.
Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical data
- Scale features
- Handle class imbalance
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyze churn by contract type, tenure, monthly charges
- Use visualizations like histograms, heatmaps
Feature Selection:
- Correlation matrix
- Feature importance from models
- Select top features
Model Building:
- Split data (e.g., 80/20)
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost
- Evaluate: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Model Evaluation:
- Compare metrics
- Use Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC
- Select best model
Model Deployment (Optional):
- Save model
- Create a web app using Flask or Streamlit
Conclusion:
The model predicts customer churn effectively, aiding in customer retention strategies.
Future Work:
- Add real-time prediction
- CRM integration
- Deep learning models
